#### Multidisciplinary Designer & Software Engineer

As a versatile digital product designer and engineer, I leverage my skills in art and technology to craft innovative solutions that seamlessly bridge the gap between empathy and functionality. 

My passion lies in creating intuitive user experiences that not only look great but also solve real-world problems. With a diverse background in UX/UI design and coding, I bring projects to life from start to finish with a keen focus on accessibility, usability, and scalability. 

From concept to completion, I infuse my work with a passion for making a positive impact through design and technology.
